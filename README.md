# to-do-buddy
To-do Buddy is a to-do list, and that's it!

To be honest, every developer should start with building their own to do list application. As for me, building this to do list is more than just a project that I want to build to decorate for my resumé (I mean, the to-do application wouldn't have a big impact on my resumé anyway, so... you know). I really wanted to build this application because I just feel like I need to make quick notes of what I should be doing throughout the whole day. I've got myself a notebook but then my brain usually doesn't function the way I want, so I keep forgettting to bring it to work (and sometimes I leave it at work). So it would be better to have an online version, and since my need is currently just a place to note some tasks, building a simple - customized application suits me better than an existing one.

## Current feature
I'm still working on the very basic CRUD for this.
